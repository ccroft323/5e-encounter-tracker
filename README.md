D&amp;D 5e Encounter Tracker App

An Python based Dungeon Master tool for running encounters in Dungeons and Dragons 5th edition. 
Project goals are to allow DM to add creatures to a running encounter space to track monster HP, initiative, and attacks/spellcasting.
Also to allow DMs to preconstruct and save encounters so they can be loaded later.
